# 🚀 Git & GitHub Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Git & GitHub Hands-On Learning Repository** 🎉

This repository is created to help **beginners learn Git and GitHub step by step** with **practical terminal commands**.  
The goal is to give you a **hands-on learning experience** — _from scratch to advanced level_ — using only Markdown (`.md`) files.

---

## 📢 Introduction

- 📝 Each lesson is a **Markdown file** that contains Git commands in **bash fenced blocks**.
- 💻 You **copy the commands** from the lesson and **run them in your terminal**.
- 🧑‍💻 By following the lessons step by step, you will learn the **workflow of real Git projects**.
- ✅ The lessons are **beginner-friendly** but cover **intermediate and advanced use cases** (branching, rebase, cherry-pick, stash).
- 🗂️ No extra setup required: just clone this repo and follow along.
